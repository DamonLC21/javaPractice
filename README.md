## SOLID

[Example Activity Feed Application](./solid-events)

A good base application to demonstrate how to refactor to SOLID.

The problem it solves is:

- Imports JSON data either from a file or from a database that represents an Event stream (like an activity feed)
- Formats the messages
- Either returns the result as JSON or as an HTML table
