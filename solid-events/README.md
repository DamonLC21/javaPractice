# SOLID Demo Application

// S = extract methods, then extract classes
// O = create interfaces and inject them
// L = create some classes for the processing of events, have some mutate and others not
// I = think about another importer, and it needs different config properties
// D = remove config properties - NOTE about how these all kind of work together
